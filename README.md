## Description
This application allows the user to add burgers to a list and then devour them or with the already eaten burgers they can re eat it to push it back to the burgers that are available to be eaten. 

## Tests
To run this application type node server.js into the terminal. 

## Issues
I ran into one small issue where I was unable to add new burgers. But with the burgers in the list I was able to move them between the two lists.
